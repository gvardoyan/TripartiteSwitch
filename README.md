# TripartiteSwitch
Compute the variance of the number of stored qubits in a tripartite switch.
In the file integralCalc.m, set k = number of links/users and M sufficiently high (greater than 20,000 recommended) and odd so that the point zero is included.
Then, simply run the script. varN outputs the variance.
